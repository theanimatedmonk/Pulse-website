<h2>Notice to End Users</h2>
<p>Our Services are intended for use by organizations. Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for controlling access. Please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization’s policies.</p>

<p>Administrators can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Restrict your access to the Services and therefore restrict your ability to edit, modify, or delete your Personal Data.</li>
    <li>Access, modify, and remove the information about you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if the Services are not currently administered or made available to you by an organization, if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g., your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and your use of the Services at a later date. Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.</p>

<h2>Information We May Collect From You</h2>
<p>We may collect information from you because we have a legal reason (allowed by law or under contract) to collect the information, or because you have consented for us to do so for a specific purpose.</p>

<h3>Information You Give Us</h3>
<p>You may give us information about you with your consent, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>By filling in a form or sending us an email</li>
    <li>By contacting us via email or some other medium to request service or support (e.g., website contact form, support ticket, CRM data, etc.).</li>
    <li>Applying for a job at Pulse</li>
    <li>Installing and using our Products</li>
</ul>

<p>When you contact us via email or for service through the helpdesk system, we will collect your name, your email address, and any other information you choose to provide. This other information you choose to provide may be personal, financial, educational, or related to your employment history. You may give us information for legal reasons, such as to enter into a contract with us, when you order products or services from us, or when you are taking a job at Pulse.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect About You</h3>
<p>If you visit our Website, we may automatically collect information about you, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Technical information</li>
    <li>IP addresses</li>
    <li>Information about what type of device you use to connect to our Website or Services</li>
    <li>The manner in which you interact with our Services</li>
</ul>

<p>Any data or information that is entered into any form on our Services is only used for the indicated purposes or as described in the present Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h2>
<p>We do not transfer or store PII data permanently on our servers. PII data will only be stored and processed temporarily for the duration of completing the product activities.</p>

<h2>What If You Choose Not To Give Us Your Personal Data?</h2>
<p>If the Personal Data is necessary to supply products or services to you under a contract between you and Pulse, then we will not enter into that contract or provide the services or goods if you do not give us your Personal Data.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 16 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. We rely on consent as a legal basis for processing personal information on our Services, hence, we may require the parent’s consent before we collect and use that information.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Pulse will respect your legal rights to your data.</p>

<p>As a processor of Personal Data, we will assist our customers and end-users with responding to individual rights requests that they receive under the GDPR. In many cases, customers may be able to address these types of requests by logging into the applicable product and using settings available within such a product or your account. Where this is not possible, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pulsegen.io">contact@pulsegen.io</a> to request assistance with any such individual rights requests.</p>

<p>Below are the legal rights that you have under the law, and what Pulse does to protect those rights:</p>

<h3>The right to be informed</h3>
<p>Pulse is publishing this Privacy Policy to keep you informed about what we do with your Personal Data. We strive to be transparent about how we use your data.</p>

<h3>The right to access</h3>
<p>You have the right to access your information. Our Services give you the ability to access and update or delete certain information about you from within the Service. In certain cases, you may need to contact the administrator of your account or your company’s account. Please contact Pulse at <a href="mailto:contact@pulsegen.io">contact@pulsegen.io</a> if you have any questions or wish to access the Personal Data Pulse holds about you.</p>

<h3>The right to rectification</h3>
<p>If the information Pulse holds about you is inaccurate or not complete, you have the right to ask us to rectify it. If that data has been passed to a third party with your consent or for legal reasons, then we must also ask them to rectify the data. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pulsegen.io">contact@pulsegen.io</a> if you need us to rectify your information.</p>

<h3>The right to erasure</h3>
<p>This is sometimes called ‘the right to be forgotten’. If you want Pulse to erase all your Personal Data and we do not have a legal reason to continue to process and hold it, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pulsegen.io">contact@pulsegen.io</a>.</p>

<h3>The right to restrict processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to ask Pulse to restrict how we process your data. This means we are permitted to store the data but not further process it. We keep just enough data to make sure we respect your request in the future. If you want us to restrict processing of your data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pulsegen.io">contact@pulsegen.io</a>.</p>

<h3>The right to object</h3>
<p>You have the right to object to Pulse processing your data even if it is based on our legitimate interests, the exercise of official authority, direct marketing (including data aggregation), and processing for purposes of statistics. If you wish to object please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pulsegen.io">contact@pulsegen.io</a>.</p>

<h3>The right to data portability</h3>
<p>If you want Pulse to port your data elsewhere, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pulsegen.io">contact@pulsegen.io</a>.</p>

<h3>The right to complain to a Supervisory Authority</h3>
<p>You have the right to complain to the supervisory authority for data protection. In India, this is the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India. You can also complain to the European Supervisory Authority in the country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach has happened.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your Personal Data and employ security measures to protect your information. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Services. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>Retention of Personal Data</h2>
<p>We retain Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect it, unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
